# Goal Tracking Application. By Vince Fernald.

# Summary

To complete this project, I used the concept of KVIs (key-value indicators). First, you set a goal and determine how many "kvi" you want to associate with that goal. You then create a few "milestones", each with KVI values that total the amount of KVIs for the parent goal.You track your progress by logging "progress" for each milestone. 

For example, let's say you want to assign 100 KVIs to the goal of "Becoming more fit." You will assign two milestones with 50 KVIs each: "Run 10 miles" (50 KVI) and "Don't eat sugar for 30 days" (50 KVI). 50 + 50 = 100. Then let's say you complete the milestone of "Run 10 miles" in two progress logs...each with "I ran 5 miles today"(25 KVI each). The Milestone of "Run 10 miles"(50 KVI) is complete because you have two progress logs of "Ran 5 miles"(25 KVI)

Database name: member_system. 

Four tables:
users, 
goal, 
milestone, 
progress

I uploaded the SQL statements to create the database here: /data/data-schema.txt.

## Possible next steps in this project:
- Make my files a little more organized (controllers, models, etc)
